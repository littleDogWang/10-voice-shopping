# Voice Shopping Assistant Architecture

## Components

The browser uses Agora RTC for audio and RTM for transcript and Agent events. Next.js only signs credentials and starts/stops the managed Agent. No business session, data API, local file store or persistent application database is required. Native Node.js, Docker and a Next.js-compatible serverless deployment use the same conversation flow. Actual hosted voice acceptance remains a separate check.

## Start and stop

The page requests an RTC/RTM token and starts the managed Agent using requester_id and channel_name. RTM is ready before the RTC conversation component mounts. End conversation stops the Agent, logs out RTM and unmounts hook-owned media. No customer, shopping, follow-up or event session participates in startup.

## State

Scenario instructions and static public reference material are bundled with the app. Current-call transcript, activity and Inspector state live in browser memory. There is no business Map, writable result file, business API or application database.

## Ownership and invariants

LandingPage owns bootstrap and RTM. ConversationComponent owns RTC/toolkit subscriptions and uses the StrictMode guard. Preserve local-user UID normalization and interrupted turns. Token, invite and stop routes own privileged operations. lib/agent-tools.ts always returns an empty list.

## Deployment

The browser uses Agora RTC for audio and RTM for transcript and Agent events. Next.js only signs credentials and starts/stops the managed Agent. No business session, data API, local file store or persistent application database is required. Native Node.js, Docker and a Next.js-compatible serverless deployment use the same conversation flow. Actual hosted voice acceptance remains a separate check.

Supply NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID at build and runtime and keep NEXT_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE server-only. No persistent volume is required. Synthetic verification does not prove real speech or hosted reachability.
