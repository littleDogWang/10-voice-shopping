# Voice Shopping Assistant

## 1. Overview

Compare illustrative microphones and cameras and talk through your preferences. This first version is conversation-only. No business data lookup, external tools, database, record writes, saved results, or cross-session business history are available. Keep user-provided details only in the current conversation. Never claim an order, appointment, registration, feedback submission, callback, payment, shipment or other external action was created, saved or completed. Offer a verbal summary and explain the appropriate human next step instead. Do not request passwords, verification codes, payment details or unnecessary personal identifiers.

## 2. Try the Demo

Run the app using [local setup](README.md#run-it). Choose `Start voice shopping`, allow microphone access and try:

- I need a USB microphone for video calls under 150 dollars.
- Compare a desk camera with a studio camera for recording.

Ask for a verbal recap before ending. Only the current page retains the transcript and session diagnostics; no business record is created.

## 3. Architecture & Tech Stack

The browser uses Agora RTC for audio and RTM for transcript and Agent events. Next.js only signs credentials and starts/stops the managed Agent. No business session, data API, local file store or persistent application database is required. Native Node.js, Docker and a Next.js-compatible serverless deployment use the same conversation flow. Actual hosted voice acceptance remains a separate check.

Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, agora-agents, Agora RTC/RTM and the adopted agent-ui components provide the existing voice lifecycle.

## 4. Prerequisites & Configuration

Use Node.js 22+, pnpm 9.15.9 and an Agora project with RTC, Signaling and Conversational AI. Configure `env.local.example` in `.env.local`.

| Variable | Required | Exposure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID` | Yes | Public; build and runtime |
| `NEXT_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` | Yes | Server runtime only |

The default managed pipeline needs no vendor key. Business-tool origins and business-storage variables are not used.

## 5. Quick Start

~~~bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run doctor
pnpm run dev
~~~

Create .env.local from env.local.example only when absent, fill the two required values, and open http://localhost:3000. Keep existing credentials when reusing a checkout.

## 6. How It Works

The start action requests a combined RTC/RTM token and starts the managed Agent with only requester_id and channel_name. The assistant follows lib/agent-config.ts. No business session is created before voice startup, and legacy tool environment variables cannot enable business operations.

See [the scenario guide](docs/scenario/README.md) for the conversation boundary and [acceptance cases](docs/scenario/acceptance.md) for checks.

## 7. Customize for Your Business

Edit lib/agent-config.ts for the role, workflow, greeting and static public reference material. Edit lib/presentation.ts for the scenario entry and visible identity. Keep lib/runtime-profile.ts aligned with the invite route. Adding business integrations is outside this first version.

## 8. Deployment & Validation

Follow [deployment instructions](README.md#deployment). Run pnpm run verify; run pnpm run verify:docker separately when checking the container. Supply the public App ID at build and runtime and keep the App Certificate server-only.

Mocked startup and build checks do not establish real speech quality or hosted connectivity. Verify actual two-way speech, transcript, interruptions, error handling and clean stop with real project credentials.
