# Agent Development Guide

This guide is for coding agents making changes in `09-voice-shopping`.


## U.S. scenario content

Use a United States setting for fictional business examples, UI copy, Agent context and sample data. Use U.S. cities and addresses, American English (`en-US`), USD for configured prices, and U.S. local dates and times. Use an explicit IANA time zone and the date-correct UTC offset, including daylight saving time; keep data, prompts, tools, exports and UI labels consistent. Do not introduce East Asian locations, regional currencies or time zones into scenario examples. Keep fictional data clearly distinguished from live business facts. Preserve original source citations and third-party license attribution accurately.

## Repository language

Use English for repository content, including documentation, code comments, UI copy and examples. Keep future additions and edits free of Chinese text.

## Scenario 09 workflow

This repository is Voice Shopping: fixed fictional electronics, server-priced basket quotes and saved unpaid simulated orders. Use `lib/voice-shopping/shopping.ts` for storage/business rules and `shopping-types.ts` for response contracts. Shopping APIs live under `app/api/scenarios/09-voice-shopping/`; `hooks/use-shopping.ts` and `ShoppingWorkbench` own browser state and display. `LandingPage` passes the shopping session into invite; tools bind it server-side.

Run `pnpm run verify:shopping` alongside the base checks. Tests must use an isolated `SHOPPING_DATA_FILE`. Never confirm an edited quote, invent tool success, accept caller prices, expose other sessions or describe simulated orders as real purchases. Preserve explicit confirmation and idempotency. The local ledger supports one Node process with persistent disk; do not claim distributed/serverless persistence. `TOP_TEN_SCENARIO_TOOL_BASE_URL` must be a cloud-reachable origin for voice tools.

Use vendored agent-ui Dialog, ConversationPanel and VoiceDock with real callbacks and transcript/status; see `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. Default build output is `.next`; `NEXT_DIST_DIR` can isolate local build output. Live speech/tool acceptance is separate from API checks and browser acceptance.

## How to Load

This repository uses progressive disclosure documentation. Docs live under `docs/ai/` in three levels.

1. Read [docs/ai/L0_repo_card.md](docs/ai/L0_repo_card.md) to identify the repo.
2. Load ALL 8 files in [docs/ai/L1/](docs/ai/L1/). They are small — load all upfront.
3. Follow L2 deep-dive links only when L1 isn't detailed enough. The index is at [docs/ai/L1/L2/_index.md](docs/ai/L1/L2/_index.md).

This repo is a standalone scenario derivative of the official voice quickstart. Also read [docs/ai/RECIPE.md](docs/ai/RECIPE.md) when evaluating extension points, invariants, or stable contracts.

The sections below (Start Here, Patterns, Anti-Patterns, etc.) remain the canonical contributor handbook for hands-on work; the `docs/ai/` tree is the structured summary used by AI agents.

## Start Here

- Read [README.md](./README.md) for setup, commands, verification, and deployment.
- Use [docs/ai/RECIPE.md](docs/ai/RECIPE.md) for this scenario's extension points, invariants and stable contracts.
- Use [docs/ai/L1/L2/from_scratch_bootstrap.md](docs/ai/L1/L2/from_scratch_bootstrap.md) for the baseline implementation map.
- Use [docs/ai/L1/L2/transcript_pipeline.md](docs/ai/L1/L2/transcript_pipeline.md) for transcript and RTM behavior.
- For layout and responsibilities inside `components/`, `app/api/`, and `lib/`, use [docs/ai/L1/03_code_map.md](docs/ai/L1/03_code_map.md) and [docs/ai/L1/02_architecture.md](docs/ai/L1/02_architecture.md).

## Current System Shape

- App shell: Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, and TypeScript
- Client RTC: `agora-rtc-react` hooks over `agora-rtc-sdk-ng`
- Messaging: `agora-rtm` for transcripts, agent state, metrics, and error events
- Toolkit core: `agora-agent-client-toolkit` for `AgoraVoiceAI`, transcript helpers, and turn status
- UI components: vendored agent-ui source, scenario-01 theme, application-owned activity canvas; see THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md.
- Server SDK: `agora-agents` for managed agent session startup
- API routes: token generation, agent invite, chat, and stop routes live in `app/api`
- Default agent config: Agora-managed STT, LLM and TTS. `.env.local` requires the two Agora project credentials; optional scenario variables are documented in README.

## Supported Modes

Local development runs one Next.js process at http://localhost:3000 using `.env.local`. Native production uses `pnpm run build` then `pnpm run start`. Docker runs the same app as non-root UID 1001 on port 3000, without a reverse proxy inside the image. Use one Node process with persistent writable disk for the atomic JSON ledger. `SHOPPING_DATA_FILE` can choose the ledger path. The browser keeps a bearer shopping-session ID in localStorage; it is not customer login. Ephemeral or multi-process hosting cannot provide this store's persistence guarantees.

Use Node.js 22+ and pnpm 9.15.9. The tracked example is `env.local.example`; local Next.js uses `.env.local`. Docker embeds the public App ID at build time, accepts the certificate only at runtime, and keeps the writable data directory owned by UID 1001. Run `pnpm run verify:docker` separately from `pnpm run verify`; see [README deployment](README.md#deployment).

## Routing / Ownership

- UI and RTC/RTM client lifecycle live in `components`.
- Browser-facing API routes live in `app/api`.
- Constants, Agent config/tools, presentation and business modules live in `lib`; this repo owns its complete implementation.
- Types live in `types`; business documentation lives in `docs/scenario`. Do not reintroduce a root multi-scenario registry.
- If a workflow, request contract, or ownership boundary changes, update `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and the relevant `docs/ai/` files in the same change.

## Key Files

- `app/api/generate-agora-token/route.ts`: issues RTC + RTM tokens for the browser user.
- `app/api/invite-agent/route.ts`: starts the managed agent session; edit here for system prompt, VAD, model, or voice changes.
- `app/api/stop-conversation/route.ts`: stops the agent session.
- `app/api/chat/completions/route.ts`: HTTP entry for the optional custom-LLM SSE proxy; implementation and test injection live in `lib/chat-completions.ts` (not wired by default).
- `components/LandingPage.tsx`: session bootstrap, RTM setup, provider wiring, and conversation lifecycle.
- `components/ConversationComponent.tsx`: RTC join, mic publication, `AgoraVoiceAI` init, transcript state, and renewals.
- `components/ShoppingWorkbench.tsx`: catalog, comparison, basket confirmation and saved orders.
- `components/ScenarioInspector.tsx`: retained session metrics, evidence and manual outcomes.
- `components/agent-ui/conversation-panel.tsx`: live shopping transcript.
- `lib/agora.ts`: shared agent UID defaults.
- `lib/conversation.ts`: transcript normalization and message segmentation.
- `env.local.example`: local environment template.
- `scripts/verify-api-contracts.ts`: route contract verification.

## Patterns

### StrictMode Guard (`isReady`)

Both `useJoin` and `useLocalMicrophoneTrack` are gated by `isReady` to prevent double initialization in React StrictMode dev mode. The cleanup fires synchronously before any `setTimeout`, so only the real second mount's timer fires.

```tsx
const [isReady, setIsReady] = useState(false);
useEffect(() => {
  let cancelled = false;
  const id = setTimeout(() => {
    if (!cancelled) setIsReady(true);
  }, 0);
  return () => {
    cancelled = true;
    clearTimeout(id);
    setIsReady(false);
  };
}, []);
const { isConnected: joinSuccess } = useJoin(config, isReady);
const { localMicrophoneTrack } = useLocalMicrophoneTrack(isReady);
```

### Hook Ownership

- `useJoin` owns `client.leave()`; never call it manually.
- `useLocalMicrophoneTrack` owns track lifecycle; do not manually call `.close()`.
- `usePublish` owns publish state; mute with `track.setEnabled()` and do not manually unpublish.

### AgoraVoiceAI Init

Initialize `AgoraVoiceAI` from `agora-agent-client-toolkit` inside `ConversationComponent`, gated on `isReady && joinSuccess`.

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isReady || !joinSuccess) return;
  // AgoraVoiceAI.init() is called here exactly once.
}, [isReady, joinSuccess]);
```

`isReady` becomes true only after the StrictMode fake-unmount cycle completes. Once `isReady` is true, React does not double invoke the effect for later dependency changes such as `joinSuccess` becoming true.

### Transcript and UI Mapping

- Manage `transcript` and `agentState` through `useState` plus `ai.on(TRANSCRIPT_UPDATED, ...)` and `ai.on(AGENT_STATE_CHANGED, ...)`.
- The toolkit uses `uid="0"` as a sentinel for the local user's speech. Remap that value to `client.uid` before passing messages into `ConversationPanel`, or user speech renders on the agent side.
- Include `INTERRUPTED` turns in `messageList`; filter only `IN_PROGRESS`. If the agent's first turn is interrupted and omitted, `messageList` stays empty and the transcript panel never shows that first turn.

### Tokens and Styling

- RTM token access must come from `RtcTokenBuilder.buildTokenWithRtm`; a standard RTC-only token does not grant RTM access.
- Tailwind 4 scans UIKit with the @source directive in app/globals.css.

## Working Rules

- Prefer the smallest change that keeps the quickstart copyable and production-style.
- Keep RTC client creation StrictMode-safe with `useRef`, not `useMemo`.
- Keep token generation on `RtcTokenBuilder.buildTokenWithRtm`.
- Keep transcript UID remapping aligned with the toolkit sentinel behavior.
- Do not require third-party vendor API keys unless the code actually introduces a BYOK provider path.
- Keep README, AGENTS, and `docs/ai/` aligned with implementation changes.

## Commands

Pinned toolchain: Node.js 22+ and pnpm 9.15.9. `pnpm run verify` is canonical and includes every scenario check. `pnpm run verify:template` checks repository contracts; `pnpm run verify:docker` builds and smoke-tests the production container separately. The full command list is in [README](README.md#commands).

From the repo root:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run doctor
pnpm run dev
pnpm run verify
```

Useful narrower checks:

```bash
pnpm run lint
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run verify:api
pnpm run build
```

## Verification Safety

- Safe without live Agora credentials:
  - `pnpm run lint`
  - `pnpm run typecheck`
  - `pnpm run verify:api`
  - `pnpm run build`
- Requires local env setup but not a live Agora session:
  - `pnpm run doctor`
  - `pnpm run verify`
- Often blocked inside restricted sandboxes because of port binding or process spawning:
  - `pnpm run dev`

## Anti-Patterns / What NOT To Do

- Do not call `client.leave()` manually; it breaks `useJoin` cleanup.
- Do not call `localMicrophoneTrack.close()` manually; it breaks hook ownership.
- Do not remove the `isReady` guard.
- Do not set `reactStrictMode: false` as a workaround.
- Do not use the deprecated `turnDetection.type: 'agora_vad'` flat API; use `turnDetection.config.start_of_speech` and `turnDetection.config.end_of_speech`.
- Do not replace `RtcTokenBuilder.buildTokenWithRtm` with an RTC-only token builder.
- Do not hide SDK requirements only in `CLAUDE.md`; all agent-facing guidance belongs in `AGENTS.md`.

## Done Criteria

Before finishing a change:

1. Run the narrowest relevant verification command.
2. For shipped app/runtime changes, ensure `pnpm run verify` passes.
3. If you changed files in `components/` or `app/api/`, verify that `README.md`, this file, and the relevant `docs/ai/` files still match the implementation.
4. Update root README and affected docs when workflow, request contracts, architecture, or environment guidance changes.
5. If the change touches workflows, interfaces, gotchas, or security details, update the matching file under [docs/ai/L1/](docs/ai/L1/) and bump `Last Reviewed` in [docs/ai/L0_repo_card.md](docs/ai/L0_repo_card.md).

## Git Conventions

### Commit messages — conventional commits

- **Format:** `type: description` or `type(scope): description`
- **Types:** `feat:` (new feature), `fix:` (bug fix), `chore:` (maintenance, version bumps), `test:` (test additions/changes), `docs:` (documentation)
- **Scoped variant:** `feat(scope):`, `fix(scope):` — e.g. `feat(api): add stop-conversation status flag`
- **Lowercase after prefix** — `feat: add feature`, not `feat: Add feature`
- **Present tense** — "add feature", not "added feature"
- **PR number appended** — `feat: add feature (#123)`

### Branch names

- **Format:** `type/short-description` — lowercase, hyphen-separated
- **Types match commit types:** `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `test/`, `docs/`
- **Examples:** `feat/agent-metrics`, `fix/transcript-uid`, `docs/progressive-disclosure`

### General rules

- **No AI tool names** — never mention claude, cursor, copilot, cody, aider, gemini, codex, chatgpt, or gpt-3/4 in commit messages or PR descriptions.
- **No Co-Authored-By trailers** — omit AI attribution lines.
- **No `--no-verify`** — let git hooks run normally.
- **No git config changes** — do not modify `user.name` or `user.email`.

## Local conversation and optional tools

Default conversations append catalog.json products, attributes, USD prices and fixed fictional stock to the prompt. The assistant can compare products and summarize purchase intent and estimated totals; it cannot update the browser basket, create server quotes, save/cancel orders or reserve stock. Browser business APIs remain available independently. A public HTTPS tool origin enables the existing seven session-bound tools; tool-mode facts and outcomes require successful responses, with no fixture fallback.

TOP_TEN_SCENARIO_TOOL_BASE_URL is optional. Only an explicitly configured public HTTPS endpoint enables tools; malformed, HTTP, localhost and local/private origins leave tools disabled. URL validation does not prove network reachability. No tunnel, knowledge base or database is needed for the default conversation. Local checks do not establish live speech or cloud callback acceptance.

## Scenario 01 UI alignment (2026-10-21)

The local `LandingPage` UI helpers compose the entry, persistent identity, activity workspace, Inspector and Build panels around existing session bootstrap. `lib/presentation.ts` loads scenario-specific content. `ConversationComponent` reports actual activity/inspection events and uses the adopted transcript and Glass controls. Business views remain scenario-owned below the voice workspace. Tailwind 4/PostCSS, theme recipes and MiSans match scenario 01. `lib/runtime-profile.ts` displays the non-secret configured pipeline; keep it aligned with the invite route. Never treat browser fixtures as live RTC/tool acceptance.
