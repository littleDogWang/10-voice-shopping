# 06 Interfaces


## Scenario 09 current behavior

Invite additionally requires shopping_session_id. TOP_TEN_SCENARIO_TOOL_BASE_URL optionally enables voice tools; without it, voice uses local catalog facts without basket/order actions. Shopping root: /api/scenarios/09-voice-shopping. POST /sessions creates a capability session; GET /sessions/{id} reads cart/orders; POST /sessions/{id}/cart sets product_id and quantity (0 removes); POST /sessions/{id}/orders accepts quote_id and confirmed:true; GET /sessions/{id}/orders lists orders; GET/POST /sessions/{id}/orders/{orderId} queries/cancels (POST requires confirmed:true). GET /products supports q/category/max_price; GET /inventory returns simulated availability. All writes return the updated session. Orders are unpaid or cancelled, never paid. See root README for exact shapes and error codes.

> Contracts at repo boundaries: API routes, env vars, runtime events, and shared TypeScript payloads.

## HTTP Route Contracts

### `GET /api/generate-agora-token`

Query params:

- `uid` optional; invalid/zero resolves to random RTM-safe UID.
- `channel` optional; defaults to generated `ai-conversation-<ts>-<rand>`.

Success response:

```json
{ "token": "...", "uid": "1234", "channel": "ai-conversation-..." }
```

Failure response: `{ "error": string, "details"?: string }` with `500`.

### `POST /api/invite-agent`

Body (`ClientStartRequest`):

```json
{ "requester_id": "1234", "channel_name": "ai-conversation-..." }
```

Success (`AgentResponse`):

```json
{ "agent_id": "...", "create_ts": 1710000000, "state": "RUNNING" }
```

Validation failures return `400`; server failures return `500`.

### `POST /api/stop-conversation`

Body (`StopConversationRequest`): `{ "agent_id": "..." }`.

Responses:

- `{ "success": true }`
- `{ "success": true, "state": "already-stopping" }` for idempotent stop state
- `{ "error": string }` on failure

### `POST /api/chat/completions`

Optional SSE proxy path (not default runtime path). Requires `NEXT_LLM_API_KEY` and `NEXT_LLM_URL` when used.

## Event/Data Interfaces

- RTM transcript/state/metrics/errors consumed through `AgoraVoiceAI` event emitter.
- Raw RTM `message` event parsed as fallback for `message.error` and `message.sal_status` payloads.
- `AGENT_METRICS` payloads displayed by `QuickstartPipelineMetrics`.

## Environment Contract

Required:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID`
- `NEXT_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE`

This is the complete base `.env.local` contract. The optional BYOK route and provider snippets use additional variables only when a developer explicitly enables them.

## Test Coverage for Interfaces

- `scripts/verify-api-contracts.ts` asserts token generation, input validation, env failures, and SSE framing cases.

## Shared Client-Side Interfaces

From `types/conversation.ts` (high-use):

- `AgoraTokenData`: token bootstrap payload consumed by `LandingPage`.
- `AgoraRenewalTokens`: renewal callback result (`rtcToken`, `rtmToken`).
- `ConversationComponentProps`: runtime dependencies for in-call component.

## Interface Invariants

- Token payload must always include `token`, `uid`, `channel`.
- Invite route requires both `requester_id` and `channel_name`.
- Stop route requires `agent_id`; missing should never be tolerated silently.
- Token route should always return UID as string for downstream compatibility.

## Event Interface Notes

- Metrics stream entries are append-only in component state, capped to recent window.
- Connection issue records carry `source`, `agentUserId`, code/message, timestamp.
- SAL and signaling fallback payloads are parsed defensively because message schema can vary.

## Backward Compatibility Guidance

- If route response shape changes, update both client consumers and contract tests in same change.
- If adding fields, keep existing fields stable to avoid quickstart consumer breakage.
- Reflect interface changes in README and L1 docs to keep sample copyable.

## Local conversation and optional tools

Default conversations append catalog.json products, attributes, USD prices and fixed fictional stock to the prompt. The assistant can compare products and summarize purchase intent and estimated totals; it cannot update the browser basket, create server quotes, save/cancel orders or reserve stock. Browser business APIs remain available independently. A public HTTPS tool origin enables the existing seven session-bound tools; tool-mode facts and outcomes require successful responses, with no fixture fallback.

TOP_TEN_SCENARIO_TOOL_BASE_URL is optional. Only an explicitly configured public HTTPS endpoint enables tools; malformed, HTTP, localhost and local/private origins leave tools disabled. URL validation does not prove network reachability. No tunnel, knowledge base or database is needed for the default conversation. Local checks do not establish live speech or cloud callback acceptance.
