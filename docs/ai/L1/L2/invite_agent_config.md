# Scenario Agent Configuration

> Read when changing Voice Shopping Assistant's prompt, tools, provider chain or turn detection.

## Source Files

- `lib/agent-config.ts`: role, workflow, guardrails and greeting.
- `lib/agent-config.ts`: selected prompt and default/tool mode context.
- `lib/agent-tools.ts`: optional tool origin validation, schemas and server-bound scope.
- `app/api/invite-agent/route.ts`: actual SDK builder and session options.
- `lib/runtime-profile.ts`: non-secret configured provider/model display.

There are no generic Ada/ADA_PROMPT constants to edit. Use the scenario config and prompt assembly actually imported by the invite route.

## Request And Startup

The invite additionally requires `shopping_session_id`, created by the shopping session API and shared with the browser.

The server reads the App ID and App Certificate, builds AgoraClient with the selected area, and creates an Agent. The configured pipeline is Deepgram nova-3, OpenAI gpt-4o-mini and MiniMax speech_2_6_turbo. Copy the route's current builder pattern and createSession options; do not add an extra client argument or reproduce older SDK signatures.

The browser and invite route share DEFAULT_AGENT_UID. RTM, transcript/error delivery and metrics remain enabled. Session startup returns the Agent ID, creation timestamp and state; ending uses that same Agent ID.

## Prompt And Tools

Default behavior: The assistant compares prompt catalog facts and summarizes purchase intent, but cannot edit the basket, generate server quotes or save/cancel orders by voice. Browser business controls remain available independently.

Tool behavior: Seven session-bound tools can search products, inspect inventory, read/edit the basket and confirm, look up or cancel an unpaid order.

`search_products`, `get_inventory`, `get_shopping_session`, `set_cart_item`, `confirm_order`, `get_order` and `cancel_order` use the shopping API. `shopping_session_id` is validated by invite and fixed into tool paths. Quantity zero removes an item. Quote changes invalidate earlier confirmation; a repeated confirmed quote returns its original order.

There is no real purchase, payment, shipping, tax calculation, fulfillment or refund. Prices are server-derived; any cart edit requires a new quote review and explicit confirmation.

## Provider And Turn Detection Changes

Edit the actual constructor blocks and turnDetection.config fields in the invite route. Provider BYOK examples are opt-in; keys stay server-side and are not part of the default two-key environment contract. For recruitment, preserve the configured 1,500 ms end-of-speech pause and 50-message LLM history unless intentionally changing interview pacing.

## Verification

Run `pnpm run verify:api`, `pnpm run verify:scenario` and canonical `pnpm run verify`. Real microphone pacing, interruptions and cloud HTTP execution require separate acceptance; mock Agent startup cannot establish those outcomes.
