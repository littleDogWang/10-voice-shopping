# 03 Code Map


## Scenario 09 current behavior

Scenario business logic: scenarios/09-voice-shopping/{catalog,shopping,shopping-types,http}.ts. Browser state: hooks/use-shopping.ts. UI: ShoppingWorkbench, agent-ui/ConversationPanel and VoiceDock, ui/Dialog. APIs: app/api/scenarios/09-voice-shopping/sessions and nested cart/orders routes. Regression checks: scripts/verify-shopping.ts. UI provenance: styles/agent-ui/PROVENANCE.md.

```

## API Route Ownership (`app/api`)

- `generate-agora-token/route.ts`: builds RTC+RTM token via `buildTokenWithRtm`.
- `invite-agent/route.ts`: validates input/env, configures and starts agent session.
- `stop-conversation/route.ts`: stops agent and handles idempotent already-stopping cases.
- `chat/completions/route.ts`: optional OpenAI-compatible SSE proxy for custom LLM path.

## Client Ownership (`components`)

- `LandingPage.tsx`: pre-call shell, token/invite/RTM bootstrap, conversation mount/unmount.
- `ConversationComponent.tsx`: RTC join, mic publish, toolkit init, transcript/metrics/issues state.
- `ShoppingWorkbench.tsx`: catalog, comparison, basket review and saved-order presentation.
- `agent-ui/conversation-panel.tsx`: real shopping transcript.
- `QuickstartPipelineMetrics.tsx`: latency chips from metrics stream.
- `ConnectionStatusPanel.tsx` + `ConversationErrorCard.tsx`: issue rendering/severity.

## Shared Logic (`lib`)

- `agora.ts`: default constants (`DEFAULT_AGENT_UID`).
- `conversation.ts`: transcript normalization, spacing cleanup, timestamp normalization, visualizer state mapping.

## Validation and Tooling

- `scripts/verify-api-contracts.ts`: imports route handlers and validates contract behavior.
- `scripts/doctor.mjs`: local setup checks consumed by `pnpm run doctor`.
- `app/globals.css`: Tailwind 4 @source includes the installed UIKit classes.

## Fast File Lookup

- Change agent prompt/model/VAD -> `app/api/invite-agent/route.ts`.
- Change token policy/channel naming -> `app/api/generate-agora-token/route.ts`.
- Change transcript mapping behavior -> `lib/conversation.ts` + `components/ConversationComponent.tsx`.
- Change session bootstrap UX -> `components/LandingPage.tsx`.

## Additional Component Roles

- `QuickstartPreCallCard.tsx`: start CTA and pre-call messaging.
- `agent-ui/voice-dock.tsx`: real voice controls.
- `MicrophoneSelector.tsx`: input-device selection UI.
- `ConnectionStatusPanel.tsx`: summary + detailed connection issue panel.
- `ErrorBoundary.tsx`: runtime guardrail for conversation subtree.

## Type Contract Locations

- `types/conversation.ts`: request/response payloads and component prop types.
- `types/env.d.ts`: typed environment variable expectations.
- `types/jsx.d.ts` and `react-jsx.d.ts`: JSX typing support details.

## Static and Styling Assets

- `public/*`: icons, logos, and heading SVG assets used in pre-call/in-call experience.
- `app/globals.css` and `styles/globals.css`: baseline theme/layout styles.
- `app/globals.css`: Tailwind 4 CSS source scanning and semantic theme roles.

## Verification Path Mapping

- API contract behavior test: `scripts/verify-api-contracts.ts`.
- Environment and prerequisites check: `scripts/doctor.mjs`.
- Aggregate check chain: `pnpm run verify` script in `package.json`.

## Ownership Boundaries

- `components/` owns client runtime lifecycle and UI state.
- `app/api/` owns privileged operations needing app certificate.
- `lib/` owns pure transforms reusable across client modules.
- `docs/` owns human-facing implementation narrative and runbooks.

## Scenario 01 UI alignment (2026-10-21)

`ScenarioShell` and `useScenarioUi` compose the entry, persistent identity, activity workspace, Inspector and Build panels around existing session bootstrap. `scenarios/presentation.ts` loads scenario-specific content. `ConversationComponent` reports actual activity/inspection events and uses the adopted transcript and Glass controls. Business views remain scenario-owned below the voice workspace. Tailwind 4/PostCSS, theme recipes and MiSans match scenario 01. `scenarios/runtime-profile.ts` displays the non-secret configured pipeline; keep it aligned with the invite route. Never treat browser fixtures as live RTC/tool acceptance.
