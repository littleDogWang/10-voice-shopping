## Ownership Map

Business data and behavior are owned by the scenario sources above. README owns runnable setup/deployment instructions; ARCHITECTURE owns topology; internal RECIPE owns integration invariants and stable interfaces. The root RECIPE is the eight-part public narrative. CI invokes the same documented commands.
