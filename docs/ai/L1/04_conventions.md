# 04 Conventions


## Scenario 09 current behavior

Scenario invariants: prices/totals come from the catalog, confirmation uses the latest server quote, a retried confirmation never duplicates or reactivates an order, cancellation is explicit and idempotent, and session-scoped tools never accept a shopper id from the model. Preserve real RTC/RTM hooks and transcript role remapping. Keep repository prose English.

> Implementation conventions that protect lifecycle correctness, transcript accuracy, and docs/code alignment.

## React and RTC Lifecycle

- Keep RTC client creation StrictMode-safe with `useRef`, not `useMemo`.
- Use `isReady` guard (`setTimeout(..., 0)` pattern) before `useJoin` and `useLocalMicrophoneTrack`.
- Do not disable React StrictMode as a workaround.

## Hook Ownership Rules

- `useJoin` owns `client.leave()`; never leave manually.
- `useLocalMicrophoneTrack` owns track lifecycle; never call `.close()` manually.
- `usePublish` owns publish state; mute with `track.setEnabled()`.

## Transcript Conventions

- `uid === "0"` from toolkit is local-user sentinel and must be remapped to real `client.uid`.
- Include `INTERRUPTED` in history list; only filter out `IN_PROGRESS`.
- Normalize punctuation spacing for compacted provider output.
- Normalize timestamps to milliseconds before issue rendering.

## Token and RTM Contract

- Token route must use `RtcTokenBuilder.buildTokenWithRtm`.
- RTC-only token builders break RTM login/subscription.
- Renewal flow independently mints RTC and RTM tokens while keeping shared channel.

## API and Error Handling Style

- Route handlers validate required body/env early and return clear status codes.
- Stop route is idempotent for already-stopping/not-found agent states.
- Frontend logs detailed technical errors and shows concise user-facing messages.

## Styling and UI Kit Rules

- Tailwind 4 scans UIKit with @source in app/globals.css.
- Prefer existing quickstart layout components over introducing parallel shells.

## Documentation Synchronization

When changing workflow/contracts/ownership in `components` or `app/api`, update:

- `README.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/ai/RECIPE.md` if extension points, invariants, or stable contracts changed
- relevant `docs/ai/L1/*.md` and `docs/ai/L0_repo_card.md` `Last Reviewed`

## Git Conventions

- Conventional commits: `type: description` or `type(scope): description`.
- Branch names: `type/short-description` lowercase with hyphens.
- No AI tool names in commit/PR text.
- No `--no-verify`, no git identity config edits.

## Route Handler Conventions

- Parse and validate request body at the top of handler.
- Return `400` for client payload problems and `500` for internal failures.
- Keep response payloads explicit and JSON-serializable.
- Prefer helper functions for repeated env checks or error classification.

## Commenting and Readability Style

- Comments should capture lifecycle reasoning or non-obvious constraints.
- Avoid comments that merely restate code.
- Keep runtime-sensitive constraints close to the guarded code path.

## Verification Conventions

- For route or contract changes, run `pnpm run verify:api` first.
- For UI/client runtime changes, run at least lint + typecheck + build.
- Prefer narrow checks during iteration, full `pnpm run verify` before handoff.

## Pull Request Hygiene

- Keep scope small and copyable for quickstart consumers.
- Include doc updates in same change when workflow/contracts are touched.
- Use present-tense lowercase conventional commit descriptions.
- Avoid adding hidden requirements not represented in `env.local.example` and README.

## Scenario 01 UI alignment (2026-10-21)

`ScenarioShell` and `useScenarioUi` compose the entry, persistent identity, activity workspace, Inspector and Build panels around existing session bootstrap. `scenarios/presentation.ts` loads scenario-specific content. `ConversationComponent` reports actual activity/inspection events and uses the adopted transcript and Glass controls. Business views remain scenario-owned below the voice workspace. Tailwind 4/PostCSS, theme recipes and MiSans match scenario 01. `scenarios/runtime-profile.ts` displays the non-secret configured pipeline; keep it aligned with the invite route. Never treat browser fixtures as live RTC/tool acceptance.
