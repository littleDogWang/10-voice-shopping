> Trust boundaries and unsafe sample defaults.

## Trust Boundaries

The browser is untrusted. Next.js owns the App Certificate, token signing and Agent start/stop. Agora cloud processes voice and invokes only configured business tools. There is no real purchase, payment, shipping, tax calculation, fulfillment or refund. Prices are server-derived; any cart edit requires a new quote review and explicit confirmation.

## Secrets

Keep certificates and opt-in provider keys server-side in .env.local or deployment secret storage. The App ID is public and is a Docker build argument; the certificate is never a build argument. Ignore env files, .agora bindings, generated logs and local business data in Git/images. Never include them in diagnostics or screenshots. Rotate exposed credentials with their owner and redeploy the new runtime values.

## Authentication And Authorization

Token routes issue scoped expiring RTC/RTM credentials; preserve renewal of both client identities. Sample start/stop/business endpoints are not production login or tenant authorization. Random call/session capabilities only scope the simulation; they do not authenticate a real customer or patient. Add application authentication/authorization before real-user deployment.

## Input And Output Handling

Validate route and tool arguments, preserve explicit confirmation and return actual errors. Never reveal secrets, other sessions or fixture identity keys to help a caller match. Do not derive contact permission or business success from transcript keywords. Use fictional data.

Use one Node process with persistent writable disk for the atomic JSON ledger. `SHOPPING_DATA_FILE` can choose the ledger path. The browser keeps a bearer shopping-session ID in localStorage; it is not customer login. Ephemeral or multi-process hosting cannot provide this store's persistence guarantees.

The image runs as UID 1001 and owns .scenario-data; mounted storage must remain writable by that user. Existing session/storage lifetime constraints still apply inside a container.

## Security Reporting

Report privately to security@agora.io. Do not open public issues containing credentials or personal data.
